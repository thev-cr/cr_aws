# University Course Recommendation System
#
# Project Overview
#
This private project implements a university course recommendation system tailored for students. It uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression model to predict university ratings based on students' undergraduate GPA and GRE scores. The system identifies universities as "Safe", "Moderate", or "Ambitious" relative to the predicted rating. It then provides course recommendations from these universities, filtered according to the student's preferred sub-disciplines.
#
# Features
#
Predictive analysis of university ratings using KNN regression.
Categorization of universities into "Safe", "Moderate", and "Ambitious" groups.
Personalized course recommendations based on user input.
Compatibility with JSON datasets for universities and courses.
Output of recommended courses, including details like course name, university, category, and course ID.


# How to Use
#
Run the main script (recommendation_script.py).
Input the required data: undergraduate GPA, GRE score, and preferred sub-discipline.
The script processes this input against the university and course datasets.
Review the resulting recommendations, categorized by their suitability (safe, moderate, ambitious) and aligned with the student's academic interests.
# Note
